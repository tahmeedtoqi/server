## Overview

This project includes a multi-functional system that processes files and provides a Flask API for file uploads and retrieval. It is divided into two main parts:

1. **File Processing**:  
   - Splits files from a source folder (`data/`) into TXT, PDF, and image categories.
   - **TXT Files** are tokenized using GPT-2's tokenizer and converted to `.bin` files.
   - **PDF Files** are optimized and compressed (using Ghostscript and Zstandard) into `.bin` files.
   - **Image Files** are converted to the WebP format.
   - **Important:** Only the converted files (the `.bin` or `.webp` files) are copied to the `uploads/` folder. Neither the original files nor the restored files are copied.

2. **Flask API**:  
   Provides endpoints to:
   - Upload files (storing the file in the `uploads/` folder and its path in a MySQL database).
   - Retrieve the URL for a specific file using its `user_id`.
   - List all uploaded files.
   - Serve individual files from the `uploads/` folder.

In production, you can run the API with a WSGI server (like Waitress) behind an NGINX reverse proxy.

## Features

- **File Processing**  
  - TXT: Tokenization and conversion to `.bin`.
  - PDF: Ghostscript-based optimization and compression to `.bin`.
  - Images: Conversion to WebP.
  - **Only converted files** are moved to the `uploads/` folder.

- **Flask API**  
  - File upload endpoint (`/upload`) that saves files and stores paths in MySQL.
  - File retrieval endpoint (`/file/<user_id>`) that returns the file URL.
  - File serving endpoint (`/uploads/<filename>`) that serves the file.
  - File listing endpoint (`/uploads`) that lists all uploaded files.

- **NGINX Integration**  
  - Configurable reverse proxy to forward requests to your Flask API.
  - Ability to modify NGINX's configuration file (`nginx.conf`) to suit your deployment needs.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- mysql-connector-python
- waitress (or an alternative WSGI server like Gunicorn)
- MySQL Server
- Ghostscript (ensure the path is correct in the code)
- zstandard
- msgpack
- tiktoken
- numpy
- Pillow (PIL)
- tqdm
- NGINX

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

# NGINX Configuration

NGINX is used as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Flask API running on port 5000 (via Waitress). It is a powerful web server that can also function as a load balancer and HTTP cache.

## Installing NGINX

Download NGINX from the official website: [NGINX Download](http://nginx.org/en/download.html). Choose the version suitable for your operating system.

### For Linux (Ubuntu):

1. **Update the package list:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. **Install NGINX:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nginx
    ```

### For Windows:

- Download the Windows version from the [NGINX download page](http://nginx.org/en/download.html).
- Extract the zip file to a directory, e.g., `C:\nginx`.
- NGINX is now installed and ready to run from the extracted directory.

## Starting and Stopping NGINX

### On Linux:

- **Start NGINX:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```

- **Stop NGINX:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop nginx
    ```

- **Restart NGINX:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

- **Enable NGINX to start on boot:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable nginx
    ```

### On Windows:

1. **Navigate to the NGINX directory:**

    ```cmd
    cd C:\nginx
    ```

2. **Start NGINX:**

    ```cmd
    start nginx
    ```

3. **Stop NGINX:**

    ```cmd
    nginx -s stop
    ```

4. **Reload NGINX:**

    ```cmd
    nginx -s reload
    ```

## Modifying the Configuration File

The main NGINX configuration file is `nginx.conf`. Its location depends on your operating system:

- **Linux:** Typically found at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
- **Windows:** Located in the `conf` directory, e.g., `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf`.

To configure NGINX as a reverse proxy for the Flask API:

1. Open `nginx.conf` in a text editor (e.g., `nano` on Linux or Notepad on Windows).
2. Add or edit the following configuration:

    ```text
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name your_domain.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
    }
    ```

    - **listen 80:** NGINX listens on port 80.
    - **server_name:** Replace `your_domain.com` with your domain or IP address.
    - **proxy_pass:** Forwards requests to the Flask app running on `127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Save the file.
4. Test the configuration for syntax errors:

    - **Linux:**

        ```bash
        sudo nginx -t
        ```

    - **Windows:**

        ```cmd
        nginx -t
        ```

5. If the test passes, reload NGINX to apply changes:

    - **Linux:**

        ```bash
        sudo nginx -s reload
        ```

    - **Windows:**

        ```cmd
        nginx -s reload
        ```

## Common NGINX Commands

- **Test configuration syntax:**

    ```bash
    nginx -t
    ```

- **Reload configuration without downtime:**

    ```bash
    nginx -s reload
    ```

- **Stop NGINX immediately:**

    ```bash
    nginx -s stop
    ```

- **Gracefully shut down NGINX:**

    ```bash
    nginx -s quit
    ```

- **Check NGINX version:**

    ```bash
    nginx -v
    ```

- **View compile-time options:**

    ```bash
    nginx -V
    ```

For more details, refer to the [NGINX Documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/).
